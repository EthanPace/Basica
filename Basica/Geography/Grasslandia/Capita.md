The Capital city of [[Grasslandia]], [[Capita]] has a population of over 100,000 [[Grasslanders]] and assorted migrants. Many of its migrants come from overseas countries, but most come from its surrounding neighbours, largely from [[Appleand]] and [[Bohiva]]. It is a national center of production, bureaucracy, and education, with the largest school in the country, and second largest on the continent of [[Prima]]; [[The Academy Greene]]. The school is a [[List of Magic Schools|College of Magic]] mostly focused on food production and environmental stability.

Most of the buildings in the city are constructed with materials derived from the [[Whitestone Quarry]] and [[ The Kingswood]]. These materials make up over 80% of the buildings in [[Capita]], after the [[Burning of the Banner]], an event which occured around eighty years ago and killed over 2500 residents and destroyed over 300 buildings. Before that time, most of the buildings were single-home dwellings, as opposed to the duplexes and townhouses that make up most of the building in the residential districs now, and were made from wood that pre-dated the transformation of a large portion of the [[Grasswood]] into the [[The Kingswood]], which meant the building were less durable and more prone to failure and combustion.

Capita is governed by the [[Capita City Council|City Council]], which is made up of 5 [[Capital Magisters#Grand Magisters|Grand Magisters]], 10 [[Capital Magisters#Honorable Magisters|Honorable Magisters]], and 25 [[Capital Magisters#Petty Magisters|Petty Magisters]], all of whom are appointed by council vote, except the [[Capital Magisters#Grand Magisters|Grand Magisters]], who are appointed directly by the king. The [[Capita City Council|Council]] also oversees the [[Capita City Coalition of Craft Guilds|Craft Guilds]] of the city, some of which are also the headquarters of their national counterparts. The [[Capita City Coalition of Craft Guilds|Craft Guilds]] are lead by guildmembers who have climed the ranks and are appointed to the position of [[List of Capita City Guild Deans|Dean]] through member vote.

The city's largest exports are high-quality magical [[Lumber]] from [[The Kingswood]], which is magically resistant to rot, splintering, cracking, and fire, and exceptionally nutritious [[Food]], including [[Food#Wheat|Wheat]], [[Food#Alliums|Onions]], [[Food#Corn|Corn]], and luxury food items like [[Food#Cocoa|Chocolate]], and [[Food#Coffee|Coffee]]. These industries are supported massively by the city's [[Capita City Casters' Guild|Mage Guild]], which is exclusively made up of [[Green Mages]], who are [[Spellcasters]] focused entirely (or majorly) on fertility, farming, and weather magics, which they generally learn at [[The Academy Greene]], due to [[Capita City Casters' Guild]]'s hiring policies.
