[[Mercha]] \[*MER - KA*\] is a small nation situated on the east coast of [[Prima]], with a massive economy largely focused on [[Trade]] and [[Piracy]], which, in [[List of languages#Merchant|Merchant (language)]], are the same word, also meaning 'Thievery'.

[[Mercha]] has no exports and "no imports", though a not-insignificant part of its economy has origins other than domestic. The nation classes itself as a self-sufficient economy.
