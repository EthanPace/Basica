The [[Division of Races]] is a theoretical (or mythological) event that occured c. 10,000 years ago.

It occured when, having angered the ancient gods, the people of [[Basica]] were divided into seperate [[Races]] based upon their environment.

This is alternately seen as a parting gift from the [[Ancients]], or a curse by the [[Angered Ones]], before their self-imposed deaths in the form of the [[Exodus of the Angered Gods|Exodus]].
