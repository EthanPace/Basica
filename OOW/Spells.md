### Random Thoughts

If cantrips are relatively easy to learn, and all a wizard needs to cast is an education, why does the majority of any population not just learn a cantrip or two?

If it takes a lot of geniune fine-detailed research to copy a spell from another wizard's book, wouldn't each spell need a massive, thick textbook to teach it?

If the institution of private schooling exists (for the children of nobles, etc.), then because magic is a fundamental part of reality, wouldn't essentially all nobles come out with a level or two in wizard?

Why can a high level wizard still only cast first-level spells a certain number of times per day,  but then turn around and cast wish? Why do I have to upcast instead of just breaking that slot down into first-levels?
